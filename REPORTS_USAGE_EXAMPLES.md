## 🔍 Specific Business Questions You Can Answer

### Question 1: "Are we growing or shrinking?"
**Where to Look**: Total Clients card (top left)
- ↗️ +15.3% (30d) = **Growing 15% month-over-month**
- ↘️ -5.2% (30d) = **Shrinking, need action**

**Actions Based on Data**:
- **If Growing**: Maintain current strategies, consider scaling
- **If Shrinking**: Review referral sources, check marketer activity, assess market conditions

---

### Question 2: "How fast are we getting clients through the system?"
**Where to Look**: 
- KPI Hero → "Avg Throughput" metric
- Throughput Chart (detailed view)

**Interpretation**:
- **25 days average** = Excellent! Under 30 days
- **45 days average** = Slow, investigate delays
- **60+ days** = Critical bottleneck, needs immediate attention

**Actions Based on Data**:
- **Fast (<30 days)**: Document your process, train others
- **Moderate (30-45)**: Look for quick wins to optimize
- **Slow (>45)**: Deep dive into each phase, identify delays

---

### Question 3: "Who are my star performers?"
**Where to Look**: Marketer Performance Table

**Metrics to Check**:
1. **Total Clients** - Overall performance
2. **Last 30 Days** - Recent activity
3. **Avg Days** - Efficiency (lower is better)
4. **Complete %** - Success rate (higher is better)

**Example Analysis**:
```
John Smith:  45 total | 12 last 30d | 25 days avg | 69% complete
Mary Johnson: 38 total |  10 last 30d | 28 days avg | 66% complete
Bob Williams: 32 total |  8 last 30d | 32 days avg | 72% complete
```

**Insights**:
- **John** = Highest volume + fast throughput (25 days)
- **Mary** = Good volume, slightly slower
- **Bob** = Lower volume BUT highest completion rate (72%)

**Actions**:
- **Recognize John** for volume and speed
- **Learn from Bob** about his high completion technique
- **Coach Mary** to improve speed (maybe shadow John?)

---

### Question 4: "Where are clients getting stuck?"
**Where to Look**: Phase Time Chart

**Example Data**:
- Intake: 8 days average
- Onboarding: 32 days average ⚠️
- Service Initiation: 12 days average

**Insight**: Onboarding is 4x slower than other phases!

**Actions**:
1. **Investigate Why**: 
   - Are background checks delayed?
   - Is training scheduling slow?
   - Are we missing required documents?

2. **Set Goals**: 
   - Target: Reduce onboarding to 20 days
   - Track weekly progress

3. **Implement Solutions**:
   - Streamline fingerprinting appointments
   - Batch training sessions weekly
   - Pre-qualify caregivers faster

---

### Question 5: "What's our conversion rate from referrals?"
**Where to Look**: KPI Hero → "Conversion Rate" metric

**Interpretation**:
- **75%+ conversion** = Excellent referral quality
- **50-74% conversion** = Good, room to improve
- **<50% conversion** = Poor referral quality or intake process issues

**Actions**:
- **High Rate (>75%)**: Your referral sources are great, get more from them
- **Medium (50-75%)**: Qualify referrals better upfront
- **Low (<50%)**: Review referral sources, improve intake process, train marketers

---

### Question 6: "Which marketers need help?"
**Where to Look**: Marketer Performance Table

**Red Flags to Watch**:
- ⚠️ **Low "Last 30 Days"** = Inactive or struggling recently
- ⚠️ **High "Avg Days"** = Slow throughput, needs process training
- ⚠️ **Low "Complete %"** = Many clients stuck, needs coaching

**Example Problem Case**:
```
Mike Brown: 17 total | 2 last 30d | 48 days avg | 58% complete
```

**This tells you**:
- Very low recent activity (only 2 last month)
- Slow throughput (48 days vs team average of 30)
- Lower completion rate (58% vs team average of 70%)

**Coaching Actions**:
1. **One-on-one meeting**: Understand challenges
2. **Shadow top performer**: Learn faster processes
3. **Set improvement goal**: Get to 30-day average
4. **Check-in weekly**: Track progress

### Question 7: "Are we seasonal? When should we hire more?"
**Where to Look**: Client Intake Trend Chart

**Example Pattern**:
```
Jan: 12 clients
Feb: 14 clients
Mar: 18 clients
Apr: 22 clients
May: 28 clients ⬆️
Jun: 30 clients ⬆️
```

**Insight**: Clear upward trend, accelerating in spring/summer

**Actions**:
- **Staffing**: Hire additional support staff before June peak
- **Marketing**: Double down on campaigns in Q2
- **Capacity**: Ensure you can handle 30+ clients/month

**Opposite Pattern (Declining)**:
```
Jan: 28 clients
Feb: 26 clients
Mar: 22 clients
Apr: 18 clients ⬇️
May: 14 clients ⬇️
```

**Actions**:
- **Marketing**: Launch aggressive referral campaign
- **Analysis**: Why are referrals declining?
- **Retention**: Focus on keeping current clients longer

### Question 8: "Which counties should we focus on?"
**Where to Look**: Clients by County Chart

**Example Data**:
1. Franklin County: 45 clients
2. Delaware County: 32 clients
3. Fairfield County: 18 clients
4. Summit County: 12 clients
5. ...rest under 10

**Insights**:
- **Franklin** = Clear leader, keep investing here
- **Delaware** = Strong #2, growth opportunity
- **Fairfield** = Moderate, could improve
- **Summit** = Underperforming, investigate why

**Actions**:
- **Top Counties**: Maintain presence, ask for more referrals
- **Medium Counties**: Target growth campaigns, attend community events

## ✨ Success Story Example

**Before**: "We don't really know how fast we move clients or who performs best. We just guess."

**After**: "We saw that onboarding was taking 45 days on average. We streamlined fingerprinting and got it down to 22 days. That's a 51% improvement! We also recognized Sarah as our top performer with a 78% completion rate and had her train the team. Overall throughput dropped from 52 days to 31 days in 3 months."

**Result**: More clients served, happier staff, data-driven decisions!
