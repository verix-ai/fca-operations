## FCA Operations Platform – Client Overview

### What this platform does
The FCA Operations Platform is a centralized workspace that helps your team bring new clients on board, coordinate work across staff and marketers, and clearly see progress from first contact through the start of services.

### Who will use it
- **Administrators**: Full control. Invite users, manage roles, configure programs and service regions, and oversee operations.
- **Employees (Operations Team)**: Run the day-to-day—track clients through phases, update details, and keep everything moving.
- **Marketers**: Use a dedicated, simpler portal to add prospects/referrals, track their client progress, and send questions to the admin team.

### How people sign in
- The platform uses secure, modern sign‑in. Administrators send invite links to marketers and employees to create their accounts.
- After accepting the invite, users sign in and see only the tools and information appropriate for their role.

### Experience by role
#### Admin & Operations (main workspace)
- **Operations Dashboard**: A live board showing every client in three clear stages—Intake, Onboarding, and Service Start. Tasks within each stage indicate what’s done and what’s left. As required tasks are completed, clients move forward.
- **Referral Prospects**: A dedicated tab lists all newly submitted referrals awaiting review. Each prospect shows the key details from the FCA Referral Form so admins can quickly approve or request more info.
- **State approval tracking**: Every prospect clearly shows its state approval status (Pending, Approved, or Denied) so the team knows exactly where it stands and what to do next.
- **Clients Directory**: A searchable, filterable list of all clients (by name, caregiver, location, program, stage). Quick actions let you view, edit, or remove a record.
- **Client Profile**: A detailed view for each client with tabs for Overview, Edit Details, Notes, and Team Messages. See the intake date, caregiver information, program, and all current tasks.
- **Case Assignment Alerts**: When a marketer submits the FCA Referral Form, administrators receive a notification to assign the case to a case management company. The client record is created from the referral—no separate “Add a new client” step.
- **Reports & Analytics**: Visual summaries of key metrics—how many clients are in each stage, where they are by county, which programs are most active, top marketers by referrals, and overall cost share trends.
- **Messages & Collaboration**: A focused space to keep conversations organized around clients or topics. Marketer inquiries appear here for follow‑up and resolution.
- **Settings**: Manage Programs, Marketers, and Service Regions (counties) so the system reflects how your organization operates.
- **User & Role Management**: Invite new users via email, assign or change roles (admin, employee, marketer), and deactivate/reactivate accounts as staff changes.

#### Marketer Portal (separate view)
- **Simple home screen** tailored for marketers to quickly:
  - Start a case by submitting the FCA Referral Form.
  - Track the status of their clients as they move through Intake → Onboarding → Service Start.
  - Submit an inquiry to the admin team when they need help or clarification, and see responses in one place.
- This portal shows only what a marketer needs—no extra admin tools—so it stays fast and easy to use.

### Core workflows
- **Start with the FCA Referral Form (Marketer)**: The marketer opens the FCA Referral Form to enter referral and basic client details. Submitting the form automatically creates the client record and places it at the start of the pipeline.
- **Admin notification and case assignment**: The platform notifies administrators that a new referral has arrived. An admin assigns the case to the appropriate case management company.
- **Review and approve Referral Prospects**: New submissions appear under the “Referral Prospects” tab. Prospect will go through the State apporval process. State will approve or Deny.
- **Convert to Client (one click)**: Once the State approves, an admin clicks “Convert to Client” to promote the prospect to a full client record and move it into the Intake stage; it is removed from the Referral Prospects list.
- **If the State denies**: The prospect remains in the Referral Prospects list with a Denied status. Admins can request more information, re‑submit when appropriate, or archive the prospect.
- **Move clients forward**: As each checklist item is completed in a stage, the client moves to the next stage automatically when they’re ready.
- **Find and update information**: Use the Clients Directory to quickly search by name, caregiver, location, program, or stage. Open the Client Profile to view or update details, leave notes, or send a message to teammates.
- **Submit and manage inquiries**: Marketers can send questions or requests to the admin team directly from their portal. Admins triage, assign, comment, and resolve them.
- **Understand performance**: The Reports area highlights trends—volume of new intakes, time spent in stages, distribution by county/program, and which marketers are producing results.

### Data and security
- **Secure sign‑in**: Users log in through a trusted identity provider. Admins control who gets access via email invitations.
- **Role‑based access**: Marketers see only their clients and inquiries. Employees and admins see broader operational views, and admins have full control.
- **Reliable cloud storage**: All data lives in a secure cloud environment (such as AWS or Google Cloud). Information is protected, access‑controlled, and backed up. Actions are tracked so you can see who changed what and when.
