## 🔢 Calculate Your Own Metrics

### Growth Rate
```
(This Month - Last Month) / Last Month × 100 = Growth %
Example: (30 - 25) / 25 × 100 = 20% growth
```

### Throughput Time
```
Sum of (Days from Created to Now) / Number of Clients = Avg Days
Example: (30 + 25 + 35 + 20) / 4 = 27.5 days average
```

### Conversion Rate
```
(Total Clients / Total Referrals) × 100 = Conversion %
Example: (75 / 100) × 100 = 75% conversion
```

### Completion Rate
```
(Clients in Service / Total Clients) × 100 = Completion %
Example: (60 / 100) × 100 = 60% completion
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"All my charts say 'No data'"**
- You need at least 5-10 clients for meaningful insights
- Keep entering data, charts will populate

**"My growth shows +100%"**
- This is normal when starting from 0 or very low numbers
- Percentages stabilize as you add more data

**"I don't see Marketer Table"**
- This is hidden for marketers (they only see their own stats)
- Visible to admins/managers only

**"Throughput seems too high"**
- Remember: This measures from creation date to now
- Older clients will show higher numbers
- Focus on recent months for accurate picture
